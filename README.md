# Haydnquiz

Haydnquiz is a platform for creating a Quiz to play with a group of friends.
Each Quiz covers a number of managable questions from an array of different question types, such as Hearing, Choice and Sort Questions.
Questions can be created through a dedicated form.
Users can put stops at one or many questions after which players have the option to upload their answers into the system. 
Answers can be evaluated and points will automatically be added to determine the winning team.

## Usage

Haydnquiz uses nextjs and connects to a mongodb instance for authentication and persisting user data.

```
npm run dev
